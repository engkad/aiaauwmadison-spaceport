# Wisconsin Space Program's code for Spaceport
Live telemetry system utilizing LoRa and APRS to report GPS and flight data to ground. Developed by WISP students for use within a rocket in the Spaceport America Competition.

## Summary
### Purpose
The purpose of this electronic telemetry system is primarily to log flight data (GPS, Altitude, Velocity, Pressure, Temperature, Accelerometer) to an onboard SD card as well as transmit over 433MHz to ground for live data retrieval. Additionally for 2024, this system will control the airbrake system used to achieve target altitude of 10,000' AGL.

### Method
The Flight system is comprised of an MCU, sensor, and RF components stacked together, and a similarly built Ground system will receive the radio signals for display via OLED.

## Dependencies
- Uses Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
- Drivers for ESP32 Feather (or follow [this guide from Adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-huzzah32-esp32-feather/overview))
   - https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/installing.html
   - https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads
- For devices with Apple silicon, Rosetta will be needed to compile with Arduino: https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/7765785712156-Error-bad-CPU-type-in-executable-on-macOS

Hardware Libraries:
   - Adafruit GPS https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_GPS
   - Adafruit SD (installs with GPS library above)

System Requirements:
All dependencies should be compatible with Windows, Linux, and Intel/M1 macOS

## Hardware
This project makes use of Adafruit's Feather/Wing system for ease of assembly and modularity.
